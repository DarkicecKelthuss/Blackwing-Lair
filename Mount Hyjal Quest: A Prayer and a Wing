  Description
A winged visage? Could it be...?

<name>, there's no time to waste. You may have been speaking to Aviana herself, trying to return to us.

I'll need something from Aviana's past to reach out to her. High atop the ridge overlooking this shrine, you'll find a series of huge nests belonging to Blaithe, an ancient bird of prey that was once her consort. For ten thousand years he's been mad with grief.

Go to one of his roosts, and use this call to summon him. Kill Blaithe and bring me one of his feathers. 

Progress
Don't trouble yourself over Blaithe's condition. Grief robbed that creature of a soul epochs ago. He was but a shell of his former self, a beast of pure rage.
Completion
That was nasty work, <name>, but it had to be done.

And if Aviana is truly to be resurrected, then perhaps your actions have enabled Blaithe to someday come back as well?

Now let's see if we can contact our long lost guardian...
